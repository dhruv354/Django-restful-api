# Django-RestFul Api app

## requirements 

* Django - `pip install django`
* Django Rest FrameWork  - `pip install djangorestframework`
* Django Rest Jwt - `pip install djangorestframework-jwt`

### My apps
* api_basic
    

**Serializers**
* to package and unpackage api data to and from the server so that it can  be understood by other technologies and it is very customizable
* whereas for data where we dont need to alter and play with fields much its better to use ModelSerializer

**ModelSerializer**
* very easy to use and better option for smaller applications
